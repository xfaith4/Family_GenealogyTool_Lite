This is a perfect foundation. Everything appears to work as designed. Quite simple, certainly not what is envisioned for final product, but It's tiny, it works, it's fast, great start. Let's put together a project plan next in order from here, step by step. Let's research the latest and greatest free tools to implement, no deprecated resources. Three top level features that make this project valuable in the end will be 1. the visual tree navigation, how smooth and easy to scale, visually elegant and informative; 2. The analytics of the data, which will involve data cleanup, standardizing on a date format yyyy-MM-dd, standardizing locations (when reasonably sure they reference the same place). And 3. Media handling, light weight, easy to upload, thumbnail creation and a clear reference in the database to tie files to either individuals, families, or at the very least have an attribute that can show up in the analytics that makes it referenceable in the UI for visual cleanup and assignment later. Let's design our phased approach with those top 3 goals in mind and use modern tooling to accomplish it.
