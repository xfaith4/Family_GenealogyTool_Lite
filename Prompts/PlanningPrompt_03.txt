Modern free toolset to build on (no “dead” deps)

Tree / graph UI (pick 1, both free):

Cytoscape.js (MIT, no external deps, optimized for interactive graphs) 
js.cytoscape.org
+1

Add-on layout: cytoscape.js-elk (MIT) for clean, scalable hierarchical layouts 
GitHub

Apache ECharts (Apache 2.0, strong zoom/pan UX; good if we stay strictly “tree” vs full graph) 
Apache ECharts

Analytics / cleanup:

python-dateutil for parsing messy dates then storing canonical yyyy-MM-dd 
dateutil

RapidFuzz (MIT) for fast, high-quality fuzzy matching (place/name dedupe suggestions) 
GitHub
+1

Media / thumbnails:

Pillow for straightforward thumbnails (simple + widely supported) 
Pillow (PIL Fork)

Optional “big image” upgrade: libvips/pyvips (fast + low memory; LGPL for libvips) 
GitHub

Data layer + migrations (professional-grade on SQLite):

SQLAlchemy 2.x (actively released) 
SQLAlchemy

Alembic migrations 
Alembic
+1

Dev tooling (optional but “pro”):

uv for fast installs/venv management (dev convenience) 
GitHub

ruff for lint + format (dev convenience)

Phased project plan (built around your 3 pillars)
Phase 1 — “Schema + pipeline hardening” (foundation for everything)

Goal: lock down a scalable schema + migrations without breaking the current working app.

Add SQLAlchemy models + Alembic migrations (empty DB always reproducible) 
SQLAlchemy
+1

Expand schema to support:

People, families, relationships (including adopt/step flags later)

Events (birth/death/marriage/etc) + original text + canonical date

Places table + place variants table (for standardization)

Media assets + media links (person/family + future “unassigned” bucket)

“Data quality flags” (missing date/place, ambiguous parse, duplicate candidates)

Update GEDCOM import to populate the expanded schema while preserving raw/original fields

Exit criteria: fresh clone → setup → creates DB via migration → import works → tests green.

Phase 2 — “Tree navigation v2” (make it the star of the product)

Goal: smooth, elegant, scalable visual navigation.

Implement a Graph API endpoint that returns:

nodes: person/family nodes, key facts, quality flags

edges: parent/child, spouse/partner

optional: “focus mode” (subtree) + lazy expansion

Front-end upgrade to Cytoscape.js + elk layout for a clean genealogy DAG layout (handles “not-a-perfect-tree” cases better than pure tree libs) 
js.cytoscape.org
+1

UX features:

expand/collapse generations

search-and-focus

side panel details (facts + media + quality issues)

minimap, keyboard nav, “center on me”

performance budget targets (e.g., 5k nodes interactive)

Exit criteria: tree view remains smooth under large imports; navigation feels “product-level”.

Phase 3 — “Analytics + cleanup engine” (turn messy GEDCOM into clean truth)

Goal: give the user a “data quality cockpit” and a safe cleanup workflow.

Dates:

parse with dateutil, store canonical yyyy-MM-dd, keep original string + confidence/ambiguity marker 
dateutil

Places:

canonical places table + variants

RapidFuzz suggestion engine (“these two places are probably the same”) with a review queue 
GitHub
+1

Dedupe:

potential duplicate people/families (name+date+place similarity)

merge workflow with audit trail (who/when/what merged)

Analytics UI:

counts of missing/ambiguous dates

top unstandardized places

duplicate candidates

“unknown parents” / broken relationships

Exit criteria: cleanup produces measurable quality improvements without corrupting history (audit trail + undo).

Phase 4 — “Media handling v2” (lightweight, practical, referenceable)

Goal: easy upload, automatic thumbnails, and traceable DB linking.

Media ingestion:

store original file + generated thumbnail (Pillow baseline) 
Pillow (PIL Fork)

optional pyvips path for huge photos later 
GitHub
+1

hash + dedupe detection (avoid storing the same file twice)

Media linking:

attach to person or family

“unassigned media” queue with tags (so analytics can surface it)

Media analytics:

orphaned files

people with no photos

largest files / missing thumbnails

Exit criteria: uploading a large batch stays fast; DB always knows “what is this media tied to?”

Phase 5 — “Productization” (demo-ready, shareable, boring-to-run)

Goal: make it something you can hand to someone and it just works.

One-command startup remains (PowerShell)

Backups + restore + export bundles

Logging + “diagnostics” page

Optional packaging: PyInstaller for a single EXE distribution 
PyInstaller
+1

CI: unit tests + ruff (dev only) 
GitHub
+1

Optional E2E smoke tests with Playwright later (dev only) 
Playwright
+1

Exit criteria: fresh Windows machine can run it with minimal steps and no weird build failures.

Immediate next steps (the next “issue stack” to open)

Add SQLAlchemy + Alembic scaffold; migration produces the empty DB. 
SQLAlchemy
+1

Expand schema for places/media/quality flags; keep raw/original GEDCOM text fields.

Refactor GEDCOM import into “stages”: ingest → normalize → flag issues.

Introduce Cytoscape tree UI behind a feature flag, fed by a Graph API endpoint. 
js.cytoscape.org

Add the first Analytics dashboard: missing dates, ambiguous parses, top messy places. 
dateutil
+1

If you want, I’ll turn this into a clean docs/ROADMAP.md plus a GitHub Issues checklist (titles + acceptance criteria) so you can start executing Phase 1 immediately.
