I need a full assessment. This is the repo as it stands currently in GitHub. I've attempted to clone it to a different drive on my pc, follow the readme to the letter and unable to get it started successfully. Your task is to re-envision this repo, simplify, consolidate, and harden it to a working application with as few dependencies as possible, a single empty database. I would like for all the current features to exist but am willing to sacrifice everything to make it a professionally designed product that we can be proud to show off.
